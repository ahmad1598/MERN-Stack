/* CSS Transition */

/* is a excellent way to add some smoothing effects to your web. 
Transitions allow us to slow down the time it takes to transition from one style to another
We can specify how long the transition should take, which properties should be affected by the slower transition, and what kind of transition timing style it should take.
we were using :hover and :active, with using these two, state is triggered instantaneously.
But we want the transition from the regular state to the hover state to be a bit more fluid and smooth.

The four transition properties are:

transition-property
transition-duration
transition-timing-function
transition-delay

transition-property:
    allows us to pick and choose which of the CSS properties we want to transition smoothly.
With transition-property, we simply write the name of each CSS property we want to transition with commas in between each name:

.box {
    ...
    transition-property: box-shadow, border-radius, background-color;
}

we also need, by necessity, to include the transition-duration property


transition-duration
This property simply tells the transition how long it should take to complete. This is what makes the magic work:

.box {
    ...
    transition-property: all;
    transition-duration: 1s;
}



transition-timing-function:
specifies the speed curve of the transition effect
The transition-timing-function is a way to change the style of the transition from one state to the next.


.box {
    ...
    transition-property: all;
    transition-duration: 1s;
    transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;
}

transition-delay
This one simply tells the CSS how long to wait before even beginning the transition.

we'd recommend keeping the delay pretty short. Otherwise it can make your site seem slower than it really is.


Shortcut transition property
Like many other properties in CSS, there is a shortcut that allows us to define the transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay properties all together. It's called simply transition, and goes in this order:

transition: [transition-property] [transition-duration] [transition-timing-function] [transition-delay];
The square brackets [] simply indicate that they are all optional; you don't actually type in square brackets. It is very common to see something like the following in a site's CSS:

transition: all 0.5s ease-in-out;
