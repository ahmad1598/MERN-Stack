# GitHub User Finder
## V School Personal React Site

Project Requirements: https://coursework.vschool.io/personal-react-site/ 

In this project I used the GitHub API. on each key I'm making a http get 
request to check if there is any user matches with that key and if you keep
typing character, it will find a new user. if there is no user match with 
that username, it will alert you that couldn't found any user.
I used the axios library to make client-side HTTP request. Also I used the
React Context, HOC (Higher Order Component) and React CSS Transition Group.
the APP is totally responsive.
