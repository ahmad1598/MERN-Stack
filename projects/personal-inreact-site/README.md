# GitHub User Finder
I am a Github user finder. I am very good at finding all the user at GitHub.
You can find any random GitHub user and see their work. Just use Search tab 
and start typing any username. by pressing each key, if there is any Github 
username matches with that character(username), you will see the profile and 
the their last 5 repositories. Otherwise, if there is no user with that 
username, it will let you know that user not found.
