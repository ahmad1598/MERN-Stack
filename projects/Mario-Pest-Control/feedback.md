Excellent project. Styling is great, the design is clean and the functionality works great. Nice use of gifs and gradients to give it more fun.

You dont need to replicate your whole css for media queries. It will inherit the properties from the old style.
Queries will override the standard styling, so you only need to declare what properties you want changed in the media queries.

Your spacing and indentations are almost perfect. Clean and easy to read.
If you use option + shift + f vsCode will make sure you dont miss any spacing and will beautify your code.

Keep up the great work. You are right on track if not slightly ahead.
